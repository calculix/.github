Dear CalculiX users,

It would be nice if this organization will become a central place for CalculiX development. I hope GitHub will unite all of us and make CalculiX software even better and more accessible. To enter the organization, please, follow this page and wait for email with the invitation link. Then you can transfer here your projects related to CalculiX, communicate and collaborate with others. Let's make CalculiX great again! :)
