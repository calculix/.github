Dear CalculiX users,

It would be nice if this organization will become a central place for CalculiX development. GitHub could unite all of the developers and contributors and make CalculiX software even better and more popular. To enter the organization, please, [post your GitHub username here](https://calculix.discourse.group/t/calculix-source-code-repository/84/2?u=imirzov) and wait for email with the invitation link. Then you can transfer here your projects related to CalculiX, communicate and collaborate with other developers.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
